Multiprocessing vs Multithreading
Both are the ways to achieve multitasking.
Suppose mom is cooking, taking care of baby and answering phone call.
If we open task manager, we can see different processing are going on and each process has its own process ID.
Multiple threads which have its own virtual memory and address space(stack) are present in same process.
Multiple threads under a particular process share a common space, e.g. a global variable is accessible by all the threads under the same process.

Processes have their own address space.
They communicate each other with a file, shared memory or a message pipe.

Threads are lightweight.
Processes are heavyweight.

The benifit of Multiprocessing is that error or memory leak in one process won't hurt execution of another process.
But the same is not applicable in case of Multithreading cus they run under a same process and one memory leak can affect others as well as the whole mother process.

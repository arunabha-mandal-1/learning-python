Python unit testing - skip/selectively run tests in pytest

Topics : 
    1. skip tests
    2. selectively run tests using their name
    3. custom markers

'py.test -v -rxs' to see the reason of skipping

## skipping
# @pytest.mark.skip(reason="I don't want.") # to skip test
# @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info<(3,5), reason="Cuz version is greater than 3.5") # to skip test when a specific condtion meet

## performing a certain test based on 'keyword' in the the test name
>> pytest -k multiply

## tag certain test using specific name or catagory(custom markers)
# e.g. a program does run on MacOS and windows and i want to group tests based on the operating system
>> pytest -m 'mark' -v
>> pytest -m 'not mark' -v
